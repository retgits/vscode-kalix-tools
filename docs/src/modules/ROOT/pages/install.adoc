== Prerequisites 

The Akka Serverless extension may need to invoke the following command line tools, depending on which features you use. You will need https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/akkasls/install-akkasls.html[`akkasls`] at minimum, and `docker` if you plan to use the extension to build applications rather than only browse.

NOTE: This extension has been tested with version {akkasls-support-version} and higher

== VSCode Marketplace

The easiest way to get started with Akka Serverless Tools for VSCode is to download the extension from the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lightbend-labs.vscode-akkasls-tools[VSCode Marketplace {tab-icon}, window="new"] or from the `Extensions` tab in VSCode itself.

After installation, you can use the xref:command-palette.adoc[] or xref:views.adoc[] to get started.
