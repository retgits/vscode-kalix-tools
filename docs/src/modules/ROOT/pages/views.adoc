== Projects

This view controls all your projects, services, invites and members, and container registries. It is your one-stop-shop to manage and control your projects.

- You can create new projects by clicking on the `+` symbol. A wizard will ask you to provide a name and a description to create your project.
- Right-clicking on an existing project will give you the option to delete the project (and all data associated with it) or show the project details.

The project has four subcategories:

- Services: Right-clicking on a service allows you to deploy, delete, expose, unexpose a service, view logs, and view service details. Each of these commands will start a wizard to get the required details.
- Credentials: Right-clicking on a container registry credential allows you to add new container registry credentials or remove them from your project. Showing the credentials will never show you the password.
- Members: Right-clicking on a member allows you to see the details of a member in your project.
- Invites: Right-clicking on an invite allows you to invite new members and delete previously created invites.
